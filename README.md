  Inputs/Input/Input.txt: 
  
  M_ej_sun: ejecta mass in unit of solar mass 
    
  beta_min: minimum dimensionless velocity for the ejecta velocity profile 
    
  beta_max: maximum dimensionless velocity for the ejecta velocity profile 
    
  alpha: the profile index for the density of the ejecta as a function of velocity $\rho \propto v^{-\alpha}$ 

  kappa: opacity of the ejecta in unit of ${\rm cm^2/g}$
  
  Lsd_0: initial spin-down luminosity of the post merger magnetar in unit of ${\rm erg/s}$

  E_tot: total energy that would be relased through magnetar wind

  xi_sd_x: fraction of spin-down energy that would dissipate into X-ray photons.
